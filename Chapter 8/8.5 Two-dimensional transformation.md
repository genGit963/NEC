## Topic 1: Two-dimensional Translation

### Key Points:
1. **Definition**: Two-dimensional translation refers to the movement of an object in a two-dimensional space without altering its shape, size, or orientation. It involves shifting the object by a specified distance along the x and y axes.

2. **Mathematical Representation**: The translation of a point \((x, y)\) by a distance \((dx, dy)\) can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   T(x, y) = (x + dx, y + dy)

## Topic 3: Scaling

### Key Points:
1. **Definition**: Scaling is the transformation that alters the size of an object in two-dimensional space by a scaling factor along the x and y axes, effectively enlarging or shrinking the object.

2. **Mathematical Representation**: The scaling of a point \((x, y)\) by factors \(sx\) and \(sy\) can be expressed as:
   \[

   **Explanation**: The order of transformations affects the final position and orientation of the point.

6. What will be the result of multiplying a transformation matrix by the identity matrix?
   - A) The transformation matrix itself remains unchanged
   - B) The result will be a zero matrix
   - C) The transformation will not occur
   - D) The identity matrix will be scaled  
   **Answer**: A) The transformation matrix itself remains unchanged  
   **Explanation**: Multiplying by the identity matrix has no effect on the original matrix.

7. When combining transformations, which of the following is NOT a valid transformation?
   - A) Rotation
   - B) Reflection
   - C) Translation
   - D) Compression  
   **Answer**: D) Compression  
   **Explanation**: Compression is not a standard transformation; scaling achieves similar results.

8. In 2D composite transformations, if two transformation matrices \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) are combined, what form does the resulting matrix take?
   - A) A scalar value
   - B) A matrix representing a single transformation
   - C) A vector of transformed points
   - D) An array of transformation types  
   **Answer**: B) A matrix representing a single transformation  
   **Explanation**: The combined matrix encapsulates the effects of both transformations.
