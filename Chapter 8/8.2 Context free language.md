## 1. Introduction to Context Free Grammar (CFG)

### Key Points:
1. **Definition**: Context Free Grammar (CFG) is a formal grammar that consists of a set of production rules. It generates strings from a starting symbol and is defined by its terminals, non-terminals, start symbol, and production rules.
  
2. **Components**: CFG is composed of four components: 
   - **Terminals**: The actual symbols that appear in the strings generated by the grammar.
   - **Non-terminals**: Symbols that can be replaced by groups of terminals or other non-terminals.
   - **Start Symbol**: The initial symbol from which derivation begins.
   - **Production Rules**: The rules that define how non-terminals can be replaced with terminals and other non-terminals.

3. **Applications**: CFG is widely used in programming languages, compilers, and natural language processing, as it helps in defining the syntax and structure of languages.
