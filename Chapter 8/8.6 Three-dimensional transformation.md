   - C) Perspective projection simulates depth and vanishing points  
   - D) Both projections are identical  
   - **Answer**: C  
   - **Explanation**: Perspective projection creates a sense of depth by converging parallel lines, unlike orthographic projection.

4. **What is the purpose of the viewport transformation?**
   - A) To translate 3D coordinates  
   - B) To convert normalized device coordinates to pixel coordinates  
   - C) To apply texture mapping  
   - D) To rotate the view  
   - **Answer**: B  
   - **Explanation**: The viewport transformation maps coordinates from normalized device space to screen space.

5. **Which transformation adjusts the camera's position and orientation in the 3D scene?**
   - A) Modeling transformation  
   - B) Viewing transformation  
   - C) Projection transformation  
   - D) Viewport transformation  
   - **Answer**: B  
   - **Explanation**: The viewing transformation defines how the camera perceives the 3D scene.

6. **If an object is not visible in the final rendering, which stage might have excluded it?**
   - A) Modeling transformation  
   - B) Viewing transformation  
   - C) Projection transformation  
   - D) Any of the above  
   - **Answer**: D  
   - **Explanation**: Any stage in the pipeline could potentially exclude an object from rendering if transformations do not result in its visibility.

7. **What is the result of applying the projection transformation?**
   - A) The object's scale is changed  
   - B) The object is rotated  
   - C) The object is flattened to 2D coordinates  
   - D) The object's color is modified  
   - **Answer**: C  
   - **Explanation**: Projection transformation converts the 3D representation into 2D coordinates, flattening the object.

8. **How does the viewing pipeline facilitate rendering in real-time applications?**
   - A) By eliminating lighting calculations  
   - B) By providing a simplified model  
   - C) By enabling efficient computation of object visibility and rendering  
   - D) By reducing the complexity of 3D models  
   - **Answer**: C  
   - **Explanation**: The pipeline allows for efficient visibility and rendering calculations, essential for real-time applications like games.

## Topic 8: Projection Concepts (Orthographic, Parallel, Perspective Projection)

### Key Points:
1. **Projection Types**: Orthographic projection presents objects in a way that parallel lines remain parallel, while perspective projection mimics human vision, where objects appear smaller as they are farther away.
2. **Orthographic Projection**: Useful in technical drawings and CAD, it allows for accurate measurements as dimensions are preserved, but it does not convey depth.
3. **Perspective Projection**: This projection creates a realistic 3D effect, incorporating vanishing points to simulate depth, making objects appear smaller with distance.
4. **Applications**: Different projection methods are used based on requirements, such as architectural rendering, video games, and simulations, to achieve the desired visual outcome.

### MCQ Questions:
1. **What distinguishes orthographic projection from perspective projection?**
   - A) Orthographic projects with vanishing points  
   - B) Perspective maintains parallel lines  
   - C) Orthographic preserves sizes and shapes, perspective simulates depth  
   - D) Both are the same  
   - **Answer**: C  
   - **Explanation**: Orthographic projection retains sizes and shapes, while perspective projection simulates depth.

2. **Which projection method is best suited for technical drawings?**
   - A) Perspective projection  
   - B) Orthographic projection  
   - C) Isometric projection  
   - D) Schematic projection  
   - **Answer**: B  
   - **Explanation**: Orthographic projection is preferred for technical drawings as it preserves dimensions.

3. **What visual effect does perspective projection create?**
   - A) Objects appear uniform in size  
   - B) Objects appear to shrink as they move away  
   - C) Objects are displayed in full detail  
   - D) Objects are distorted  
   - **Answer**: B  
   - **Explanation**: Perspective projection makes objects appear smaller with increased distance, mimicking human vision.

4. **Which type of projection would you use for a 2D game?**
   - A) Perspective projection  
   - B) Orthographic projection  
   - C) Parallel projection  
   - D) Both A and B  
   - **Answer**: B  
   - **Explanation**: Orthographic projection is commonly used in 2D games as it preserves the object's dimensions and does not create depth effects.

5. **What is a common application of perspective projection in real life?**
   - A) Architectural design  
   - B) Video game graphics  
   - C) Engineering drawings  
   - D) Scientific illustrations  
   - **Answer**: B  
   - **Explanation**: Perspective projection is widely used in video games to create a realistic view of 3D environments.

6. **In orthographic projection, what happens to parallel lines?**
   - A) They converge to a point  
   - B) They remain parallel  
   - C) They disappear  
   - D) They distort  
   - **Answer**: B  
   - **Explanation**: In orthographic projection, parallel lines remain parallel without any convergence.

7. **Which of the following accurately describes parallel projection?**
   - A) It uses vanishing points  
   - B) It preserves angles and shapes but not depth  
   - C) It simulates perspective  
   - D) It distorts dimensions  
   - **Answer**: B  
   - **Explanation**: Parallel projection preserves angles and shapes, maintaining uniformity but not conveying depth.

8. **What characteristic of perspective projection makes it suitable for 3D visualization?**
   - A) It provides accurate measurements  
   - B) It simulates human visual perception  
   - C) It flattens the image  
   - D) It maintains dimensional proportions  
   - **Answer**: B  
   - **Explanation**: Perspective projection is suitable for 3D visualization as it simulates how humans perceive depth and distance.
