### Topic 4: Stack Application – Infix to Postfix Conversion and Evaluation of Postfix Expression

#### Key Points:
1. **Infix Notation**:
   - In infix notation, operators are placed between operands (e.g., `A + B`). It is the most common way humans write expressions but is not easy for computers to evaluate directly due to precedence and parentheses.

2. **Postfix Notation (Reverse Polish Notation)**:
   - In postfix notation, operators follow their operands (e.g., `A B +`). This eliminates the need for parentheses and operator precedence, making it easier for machines to evaluate expressions using a stack.

3. **Conversion from Infix to Postfix**:
   - The process involves using a stack to temporarily hold operators while scanning an infix expression from left to right, outputting operands directly, and managing operators based on precedence and parentheses.

4. **Postfix Evaluation Using a Stack**:
   - Postfix expressions are evaluated using a stack by scanning the expression from left to right, pushing operands onto the stack, and popping them when an operator is encountered to perform the necessary operation.

#### MCQs:

1. **Which of the following is an example of a postfix expression?**
   - a) A + B
   - b) (A + B) * C
   - c) A B +
