   - C) It determines which processes are to be executed next by the CPU.
   - D) It manages user interface interactions.  
   **Answer**: C  
   **Explanation**: Short-term scheduling (CPU scheduling) determines which of the ready processes in memory will be executed by the CPU.

4. Which of the following is NOT a scheduling algorithm?
   - A) Round Robin (RR)
   - B) Shortest Job Next (SJN)
   - C) First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
   - D) Data Transfer Protocol (DTP)  
   **Answer**: D  
   **Explanation**: Data Transfer Protocol (DTP) is not a scheduling algorithm; the others are common scheduling algorithms used in operating systems.

5. What is a key goal of process scheduling?
   - A) To minimize CPU usage
   - B) To ensure all processes are executed in real-time
   - C) To maximize CPU utilization and minimize waiting time
   - D) To eliminate the need for memory management  
   **Answer**: C  
   **Explanation**: The primary goals of process scheduling are to maximize CPU utilization while minimizing waiting time and ensuring fairness.

6. In a Round Robin scheduling algorithm, what is the main feature?
   - A) Processes are executed in a priority order.
   - B) Each process is assigned a fixed time slice for execution.
   - C) The process with the shortest burst time is executed first.
   - D) Processes run indefinitely until they complete.  
   **Answer**: B  
   **Explanation**: In Round Robin scheduling, each process is assigned a fixed time slice (quantum) for execution, ensuring fair sharing of CPU time among processes.

7. What does medium-term scheduling involve?
   - A) Prioritizing processes based on their execution time.
   - B) Swapping processes in and out of memory.
   - C) Allocating memory to processes.
   - D) Managing user interactions.  
   **Answer**: B  
   **Explanation**: Medium-term scheduling involves managing the swapping of processes in and out of memory to control the degree of multiprogramming.

8. Which scheduling algorithm may lead to the "convoy effect," where short processes wait for a long process to complete?
   - A) Shortest Job Next (SJN)
   - B) Round Robin (RR)
   - C) First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
   - D) Priority Scheduling  
   **Answer**: C  
   **Explanation**: The First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm can lead to the convoy effect, where short processes wait for longer processes to complete.

## 10. Interprocess Communication (IPC)

### Key Points:
1. **Definition of IPC**: Interprocess communication (IPC) refers to the mechanisms that allow processes to communicate and synchronize their actions while executing concurrently.
2. **Types of IPC**:
   - **Shared Memory**: Processes share a common memory space for communication, allowing fast data exchange.
   - **Message Passing**: Processes communicate by sending and receiving messages, which can be synchronous or asynchronous.
3. **Synchronization**: IPC mechanisms often require synchronization to manage access to shared resources and ensure data integrity.
4. **Use Cases**: IPC is essential in multitasking environments, enabling processes to work together and share data effectively.

### MCQ Questions:
1. What does Interprocess Communication (IPC) allow processes to do?
   - A) Execute simultaneously without any interaction
   - B) Communicate and synchronize their actions
   - C) Control hardware devices directly
   - D) Allocate memory dynamically  
   **Answer**: B  
   **Explanation**: IPC allows processes to communicate and synchronize their actions while executing concurrently.

2. Which of the following is a method of IPC?
   - A) Shared memory
   - B) File management
   - C) Memory allocation
   - D) Data compression  
   **Answer**: A  
   **Explanation**: Shared memory is one of the methods of interprocess communication, allowing processes to share a common memory space.

3. What is the primary difference between shared memory and message passing in IPC?
   - A) Shared memory is slower than message passing.
   - B) Shared memory allows direct access to common memory, while message passing involves sending and receiving messages.
   - C) Message passing is only used for communication between parent and child processes.
   - D) Shared memory is always asynchronous.  
   **Answer**: B  
   **Explanation**: The primary difference is that shared memory allows direct access to a common memory space, while message passing involves sending and receiving messages between processes.

4. Synchronization in IPC is essential for:
   - A) Enhancing user interfaces
   - B) Preventing data corruption in shared resources
   - C) Speeding up process execution
   - D) Compiling code efficiently  
   **Answer**: B  
   **Explanation**: Synchronization is crucial to prevent data corruption when multiple processes access shared resources.

5. Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of message passing IPC?
   - A) Can be synchronous or asynchronous
   - B) Requires explicit message formatting
   - C) Allows sharing of memory space
   - D) Facilitates communication between processes  
   **Answer**: C  
   **Explanation**: Message passing does not allow sharing of memory space; it involves sending messages between processes.

6. In shared memory IPC, how do processes communicate?
   - A) By sending emails to each other
   - B) By writing to and reading from a common memory area
   - C) Through graphical user interfaces
   - D) By accessing the file system  
   **Answer**: B  
   **Explanation**: In shared memory IPC, processes communicate by writing to and reading from a designated area of shared memory.

7. Which IPC method is generally considered faster?
   - A) Message passing
   - B) File sharing
   - C) Shared memory
   - D) Socket communication  
   **Answer**: C  
   **Explanation**: Shared memory is generally faster than message passing because it allows direct access to the memory space without the overhead of sending messages.

8. What is a potential drawback of shared memory IPC?
   - A) Slower communication
   - B) Complexity in managing access to the shared memory
   - C) Limited data transfer size


   - D) Lack of synchronization mechanisms  
   **Answer**: B  
   **Explanation**: A potential drawback of shared memory IPC is the complexity involved in managing access to the shared memory to prevent data corruption and ensure synchronization.
