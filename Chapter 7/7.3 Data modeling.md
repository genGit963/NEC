### 9. Normalization

#### Key Points:
1. **Definition of Normalization**:
   - Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves decomposing larger tables into smaller, related tables and establishing relationships between them.

2. **Objectives of Normalization**:
   - The primary objectives of normalization include:
     - Eliminating redundant data to save storage space.
     - Ensuring data dependencies make sense, thus improving data integrity.
     - Simplifying the data structure to make it easier to maintain and update.

3. **Normal Forms**:
   - Normalization is typically carried out through various normal forms (NF), each with specific criteria:
     - **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Requires that all columns in a table contain atomic (indivisible) values, and each entry in a column must be of the same data type.
     - **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Builds on 1NF by ensuring that all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. It eliminates partial dependencies.
     - **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Builds on 2NF by ensuring that all non-key attributes are not only dependent on the primary key but also non-transitively dependent (i.e., no transitive dependency exists).
     - Higher normal forms, such as BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form), further refine the normalization process.

4. **Benefits of Normalization**:
   - Normalization provides several benefits, including:
     - Reduced data redundancy, leading to less storage consumption.
     - Enhanced data integrity by minimizing anomalies (insert, update, delete anomalies).
     - Improved query performance, as the database is structured more logically.

5. **Denormalization**:

### 10. Advanced Database Concepts

#### Key Points:
1. **Transactions**:
   - A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. Transactions ensure that the database remains in a consistent state, even in the presence of failures.
   - Transactions follow the ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. 
     - **Atomicity** ensures that all operations in a transaction are completed successfully or none at all.
     - **Consistency** ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
     - **Isolation** ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
     - **Durability** ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains permanent, even in the event of a system failure.
