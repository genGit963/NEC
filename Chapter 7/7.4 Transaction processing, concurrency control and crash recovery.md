## Topic 1: ACID Properties

### Key Points:
1. **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing; they either complete entirely or not at all. This ensures that even in the event of a failure, the database remains in a consistent state, and any partial transactions are rolled back.

2. **Consistency**: A transaction must bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all predefined rules, including constraints, cascades, and triggers. It ensures that any data written to the database is valid according to all defined rules.

3. **Isolation**: Transactions must operate independently without interference. This prevents transactions from seeing intermediate states of others, ensuring that concurrent transactions do not affect each otherâ€™s outcome.

4. **Durability**: Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the case of a system failure. This is typically achieved through various logging mechanisms that store data in non-volatile storage.

   **Explanation:** Rollback is a recovery operation that restores the database to its previous state by undoing changes made by a failed transaction.

8. **Why is it important to maintain atomicity in database transactions?**
   - A) It allows for parallel execution of transactions.  
   - B) It prevents data corruption and maintains consistency.  
   - C) It enhances performance of the database.  
   - D) It simplifies transaction management.  
   **Answer:** B) It prevents data corruption and maintains consistency.  
   **Explanation:** Atomicity is crucial for ensuring that transactions do not leave the database in an inconsistent state, protecting data integrity.

## Topic 8: Concurrency Control

### Key Points:
1. **Definition of Concurrency Control**: Concurrency control refers to techniques used to manage simultaneous operations on a database without conflicting, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

2. **Types of Concurrency Control**: The two main types are **optimistic concurrency control**, which assumes that conflicts are rare and checks for them before committing, and **pessimistic concurrency control**, which prevents conflicts by locking resources.

3. **Transaction Isolation Levels**: Different isolation levels, such as **Read Uncommitted**, **Read Committed**, **Repeatable Read**, and **Serializable**, define how transactions interact and manage visibility of changes made by other transactions.

4. **Role of Locks in Concurrency Control**: Locks are fundamental in controlling access to database resources, ensuring that transactions can safely read or modify data without interference from others.

### Multiple Choice Questions:
1. **What is the primary purpose of concurrency control in databases?**
   - A) To enhance system performance  
   - B) To manage simultaneous operations without conflicts  
   - C) To reduce memory usage  
   - D) To eliminate the need for transactions  
   **Answer:** B) To manage simultaneous operations without conflicts  
   **Explanation:** Concurrency control ensures that multiple transactions can operate concurrently without leading to data inconsistencies.

2. **Which of the following describes optimistic concurrency control?**
   - A) It locks resources before accessing them.  
   - B) It assumes conflicts are rare and checks for them at commit time.  
   - C) It guarantees immediate access to data.  
   - D) It prevents any concurrent access to data.  
   **Answer:** B) It assumes conflicts are rare and checks for them at commit time.  
   **Explanation:** Optimistic concurrency control allows transactions to proceed without locking until they commit, checking for conflicts only at that time.

3. **What is the highest isolation level in SQL?**
   - A) Read Uncommitted  
   - B) Read Committed  
   - C) Repeatable Read  
   - D) Serializable  
   **Answer:** D) Serializable  
   **Explanation:** Serializable is the highest isolation level, ensuring complete isolation from other transactions by preventing them from accessing data until the current transaction is complete.

4. **In a pessimistic concurrency control system, what is primarily used to prevent conflicts?**
   - A) Timeouts  
   - B) Locks  
   - C) Caching  
   - D) Shadow copies  
   **Answer:** B) Locks  
   **Explanation:** Pessimistic concurrency control uses locks to prevent other transactions from accessing data while it is being modified, ensuring data integrity.

5. **Which isolation level allows for dirty reads?**
   - A) Read Uncommitted  
   - B) Read Committed  
   - C) Repeatable Read  
   - D) Serializable  
   **Answer:** A) Read Uncommitted  
   **Explanation:** Read Uncommitted allows transactions to read data that has been modified but not yet committed, potentially leading to inconsistencies.

6. **What potential issue can arise from using low isolation levels?**
   - A) Increased performance  
   - B) Reduced data integrity  
   - C) Improved transaction speed  
   - D) Simplified transaction logic  
   **Answer:** B) Reduced data integrity  
   **Explanation:** Lower isolation levels can lead to phenomena like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads, compromising data integrity.

7. **Which statement best describes the role of locks in concurrency control?**
   - A) They enhance transaction speed by allowing simultaneous access.  
   - B) They prevent other transactions from accessing data while it is locked.  
   - C) They simplify the structure of transactions.  
   - D) They automatically resolve conflicts between transactions.  
   **Answer:** B) They prevent other transactions from accessing data while it is locked.  
   **Explanation:** Locks are essential for ensuring that once a transaction accesses data, no other transaction can interfere until the lock is released.

8. **What happens when a transaction requests a lock that is already held by another transaction?**
   - A) The transaction is immediately aborted.  
   - B) The transaction is granted the lock anyway.  
   - C) The transaction must wait until the lock is released.  
   - D) The transaction is executed with reduced priority.  
   **Answer:** C) The transaction must wait until the lock is released.  
   **Explanation:** If a lock is already held, the requesting transaction must wait until the lock is available to proceed.
